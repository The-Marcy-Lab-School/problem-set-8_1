# Problem Set: Tic-Tac-Toe in React

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Directions

Make a tic-tac-toe application. The following user stories are **required** to be represented in the UX:

- As a player, I can mark a game square with my chosen symbol of "X" or "O".
- When there is a winner, the game board will clearly indicate which player won.

The following user stories are **optional** and should only be incorporated if required stories are complete:

- If no player has won, my game will indicate that there is no winner.
- The game will automatically refresh to a new game once all squares are marked.
- The game will indicate which player should go next/ whose turn it is.

Your code must meet the following requirements:

- Your project files should be organized into folders according to their purpose.
- Components must be rendered as a descendant (child or grandchild, etc.) of the <App/>
- Each component must be coded in its own file.
- Components must incorporate the hooks taught thus far.

The started code provided in [/tic-tac-toe-app](tic-tac-toe-app) could be helpful, but is optional. Feel free to start from scratch or adapt as you see fit.
